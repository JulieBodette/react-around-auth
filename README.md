# Project Name: Around the US

# Description

This is a basic social media site. Users can sign up and then log in. A JWT (JSON Web Token) is saved in localStorage, so users will not have to log in again on repeat visits to the site. Users can change their name, description, and profile picture. Users can also upload, like, and delete photos. Each picture displays the number of likes, and has a filled-in heart if it is liked by the current user. It has responsive design (works on desktop and mobile).
